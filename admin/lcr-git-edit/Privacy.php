    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>
      When you are on this website, your ip is logged by the server (automatic and unavoidable).<br>
      The ip address will not be used to find your general location, although if leaked could be. <br>
      Each account's password is encrypted prior to storing it on the site, so, it is not possible <br>
      for developers or the owner to view that password and use your account.
